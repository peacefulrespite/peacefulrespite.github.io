Released in Japan as End of Eternity on January 28, 2010, Resonance of Fate is set to be released in America this upcoming Tuesday, March 16, 2010 on both the Xbox 360 and PS3. Developed by Tri-Ace and published by Sega, Resonance of Fate mixes a steampunk setting with an untraditional turn-based RPG gameplay. However, instead of the normal weapons found in JRPGs, Resonance of Fate features guns and grenades as weapon types. Resonance of Fate also allows for a variety of character customization, allowing the player to change all three of the main characters' hair color and various articles of clothing.

Tri-Ace's most well-known series would have to be their Star Ocean series, published by Square-Enix. The visuals of most Tri-Ace's games are good, if not great, and interesting/fun gameplay is what they do best, in my opinion.<br><br>

I am personally very excited for this game. It looks like it is hilarious from the different scenes I've seen so far. It is so different in setting and style, but still has the type of gameplay I enjoy. I'll be buying this next week, when it is released, for sure. Expect some first impression and a review when the time comes.
