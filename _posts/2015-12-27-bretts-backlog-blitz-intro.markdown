I tend to dismiss the idea of a New Year's Resolution, but there is
something to the feeling of starting something new at the start of a new
year. My New Year's Resolution for 2016 is not overly complex or life
changing. My New Year's Resolution is to simply play through my game
backlog. Over the years I have amassed a catalog of games that I want to
play, but I have not taken the time to enjoy yet. I am not very good at
finishing games, and I am tired of spending money on buying new ones
before enjoying what I have. I want to change that.

That is what Brett's Backlog Blitz is all about - enjoying what I have.
Every week I am going to try to write a blog post summarizing what I
played, how I feel about it, and if I am going to keep on playing those
games. Along the way, I am going to limit the games I buy to a
predetermined list that have some stipulations. I want to also share
what games I do end up buying.

Along with the blog posts, [my
Backloggery](http://www.backloggery.com/brettchalupa) is where I will do
more granular updates and keep track of my backlog. Most of my backlog
is present on my Backloggery, but I may be missing some digital games. I
doubt I will get through my whole backlog in 2016, but I will try my
best. Also, a lot of the games I own are 20+ hour JRPGs, which can be a
bit difficult to back-to-back, so I may let some be for future years.

## Rules

These are the ground rules that I am going to try to follow:

- Write a blog post each week, published on Sunday, reviewing the week
  of games I played and how the blitz is going.
- If I am not enjoying a game, I will set it to Null in Backloggery and
  move on. Life is too short to play games I am not enjoying.
- At most I will only buy one new game a month. This will prevent my
  backlog from growing a bunch throughout the year.
- If I own the same game on different platforms without cross-save, I
  will probably not play the game on all the platforms I own it on. In
  my Backloggery, I will set the platforms I did not play the game on to
  Null.
- Games I get via PlayStation Plus (PS+) may get added to my backlog if
  I am interested in playing them. I am not going to count them against
  my buying one game a month goal.

## Games I Know I Want

Going into 2016, I know there are some games that I really want to play
and enjoy. These are games that I am definitely going to buy and play.

- __Fire Emblem Fates__ - February - I dug Awakening, which I played through
  most of when it came out, and I am looking forward to Fates. I doubt I
  will finish Awakening before Fates comes out, and I do not want to
  burn myself out on it.
- __Dark Souls III__ - April - I _really_ enjoy the Souls games, and I want
  to play Dark Souls III at release. My goal is to try to play (and
  finish) all the Souls games first  I am currently working through Dark
  Souls II, and I want to try to play Bloodborne and Demon's Souls
  before Dark Souls III comes out.
- __Dragon Quest VII & VIII__ - Summer - I am a big fan of the Dragon Quest series,
  and I know I will play VII & VIII when they release on 3DS.
- __Persona 5__ - TBA - I want to, at least, beat Persona 4: Golden, before
  playing Persona 5. I really enjoy the style, music, and characters of
  Persona games, and 5 is looking solid.
- __Final Fantasy XV__ - TBA - I enjoyed Episode Duscae, the demo, and I am
  looking forward to playing the full game.
- __The Last Guardian__ - TBA - I have been excited about this game for
  years, and I _need_ play Ico and Shadow first.

## Games I Maybe Want

There are a few games that I think that I want, but I am on the fence
about.

- __Final Fantasy Explorers__ - January - I _want_ to enjoy Monster Hunter
  (and Monster Hunter-like) games, but I always struggle to get into
  them beyond about a dozen hours. I enjoy the Final Fantasy characters
  and music, but I do wonder if I will get much out of this game.
- __Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4__ - February - Growing up, I
  loved Naruto and the PS2 fighting games. I have not kept up with the
  story, so I worry that I would be a bit lost. I played the demo and
  enjoyed it, so I will have to see. Ideally I would read the manga and
  get back into the series before playing the game.
- __Gravity Rush HD__ - February - I enjoyed what I played of Gravity Rush
  on the Vita, but I am not sure if I am up for playing it again. Maybe
  on a sale?
- __Bravely Second: End Layer__ - Spring - Bravely Second seems like more of
  Bravely Default, which is a good and bad thing. The fast-paced combat
  in the first game was awesome, but the story and characters were not
  very compelling. I will have to wait and see how this game is looking
  before making the decision.
- __NieR Automata__ - TBA - I never really got into NieR, but I am
  interested in this game because I enjoy the aesthetic of what has been
  shown so far.
- __The Legend of Zelda Wii U__ - I do not have a Wii U, and part of me is
  wondering if this will be the game to make me get one. Aside from a
  trailer and some other tidbits of info, there is not enough
  information yet to really decide.

## Other Notes

- I backed Mighty No. 9 on Kickstarter, so I will be getting a download
  code for that when it releases.
- I backed Hyper Light Drifter on Kickstarter, so like Mighty No. 9, I will
  get a download code upon release.

## The First Update

Alright, that was a lot of rambling to introduce the series. This, the
first update, is what to expect in each update.

### Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin

I started Dark Souls II right after I finished the first Dark Souls, and
I have been digging exploring Drangleic. I can't help but wonder if I am
playing too much Souls in a short time, but I am enjoying it so that is
what matters. It took me some time to get used to not leveling up at
bonfires, Estus Flask changes, and the animation tweaks (everything is
slower and more deliberate). Unlike the first Dark Souls, I have been
going in without any info about the bosses and path through the game.

I most recently made it through The Lost Bastille, but I think there is
one more boss. I am playing a dexterity-focused character.

### Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes

I finished the main-op in preparation of The Phantom Pain. I tried a
side-op, but I was not feeling it. I played a bunch of Ground Zeroes
when it came out, so I did not feel like I was missing much.

### Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain

I played The Phantom Pain for about 15 hours on PS3, so a lot of what I
have been playing has been replaying a lot of what I already played. The
intro was a bit difficult due to it being so linear and cinematic, but I
reached the point in the game where it opens up. I am really enjoying
playing the game, and I have been taking a stealth approach to missions
the first time through.

### Bravely Default

When Bravely Default first released, I played a bunch of it. I no longer
have that save, so I restarted a couple months ago. I played for a
couple hours this past week, and I reached the part of the game that was
in the demo. I played the demo a lot, and I played this part of the game
once before, so I am struggling to focus and play through it. I stopped
playing this in favor of Persona 4: Golden.

### Persona 4: Golden

I am about 10 hours into Persona 4, and I am enjoying it. I have been
mostly been hanging out and going to class. I think a rainy day is
coming soon.

## Next Week

That's all for this week! I am looking forward to what I play this
coming week. I will keep on plugging away at Dark Souls II, The Phantom
Pain, and Persona 4. I took the week off, so it should be a good week
for playing games.
