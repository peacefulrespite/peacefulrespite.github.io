Awesome video by the band vividblaze. They make amazing music, and they have also been featured on some of <a href="http://dannychoo.com">Danny Choo</a>'s videos.

vividblaze's music is generally just relaxing. The vocals are so impressive, along with the other aspects of their music.

After hearing some of their songs, I went online and started looking for their music. Well it turns out it is all on iTunes! This is great, I love when Japanese bands can be found on the U.S. iTunes store.

Definitely a band worth checking out and supporting.
