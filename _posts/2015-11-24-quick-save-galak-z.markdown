_Surviving in space has not gotten any easier._

This is the first Peaceful Respite video, and it is part of a new series
called _Quick Saves_. The goal of a Quick Save is to give a brief
overview of a game by showing gameplay and the mechanics. This is a
little taste of _Galak-Z: The Dimensional_.

I played this on a MacBook Pro 15" with a PS4 controller. Here are
the specs for reference:

- Processor: 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7
- Memory: 16 GB
- Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB

_Galak-Z: The Dimensional_ is available on PS4, Windows, Mac OS X, and
Linux.
