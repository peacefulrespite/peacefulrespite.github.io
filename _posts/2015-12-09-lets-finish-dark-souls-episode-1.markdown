A new series where I, Brett, try to finish a Dark Souls save after not
playing it for 18 months. I am about 33 hours in with the save and in
the early 70s for levels.

In this episode, I get the hang of the controls again, die a few times,
and beat my first boss since last playing. I am feeling a bit nervous
about The Tomb of the Giants, which is the next area to venture into.
