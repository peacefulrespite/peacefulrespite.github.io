2016 is set to be a great year for playing Japanese games. Here is a list of
the 20 games I am most excited to play that are coming over from Japan or are
Japanese-inspired.

All 20 of these games are expected to release in 2016. While some do not have
definitive dates yet, let's hope they make it out this year.

The release dates are for North America, may change, and may not apply to all
platforms that are targeted for release. See [the YouTube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZRKd3o0Au0) for a list of games and
videos used.

What games are you looking forward to in 2016?
