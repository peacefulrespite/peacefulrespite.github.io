2016 is set to be a great year for playing Japanese games. Here is a list of the 20 games I am most excited to play that are coming over from Japan or are Japanese-inspired.

All 20 of these games are expected to release in 2016. While some do not have definitive dates yet, let's hope they make it out this year.

The release dates are for North America, may change, and may not apply to all platforms that are targeted for release. See [the YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZRKd3o0Au0) for a list of games and videos used.

What games are you looking forward to in 2016?
