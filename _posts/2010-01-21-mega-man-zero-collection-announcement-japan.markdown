Set to come out on April 22, 2010 for 3,990 yen in Japan. This is a great price for what you're getting. The collection contains all the Mega Man Zero games, 1-4. It should be fun, I missed out on the Zero series.

<b>Update!</b>
Over on the <a href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/jgonzo/blog/2010/01/28/mega_man_zero_collection_announced_for_summer_2010_release">Capcom-Unity</a> blog it was announced that the U.S. will be seeing this game in the Summer of 2010, thank you Capcom, should be great! Hopefully it retails for 30.00 USD or cheaper, I trust Capcom with these things. They seem to do a great job with release dates and prices. Thank you Capcom!
