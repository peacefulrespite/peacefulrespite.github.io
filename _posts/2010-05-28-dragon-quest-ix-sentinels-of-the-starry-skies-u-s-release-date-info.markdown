Dragon Quest IX is set to come out in the U.S. on Sunday, July 11, 2010. So mark your calendars and get ready. The title is being released under the full name Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies. The game was developed by Level 5 and released last year in Japan on July 11, 2009, by Square Enix. What is somewhat odd is that the title is being published by Nintendo of America here. I would imagine this would mean a larger ad campaign and potentially higher sales.

Having the title released here a year exactly after its initial release in Japan is always a good thing. I wouldn't have expected anything less though with such a popular series, at least in Japan. In Japan alone, the game has sold over 4 million copies and recently was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for most played anonymously ad-hoc multiplayer.

It maintains the typical turn-based gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but for the first time in the series allows for four player local co-op.

Character customization is also in the game, allowing you to have a variety of different aesthetic options. I hope this doesn't jeopardize the story at all.

I'm glad the title is being released by Nintendo is some ways. Picking it up on a Sunday will give me most of the day (hopefully) to play it.

Look forward to more information as the date approaches!
