With Peaceful Respite just getting started, I thought it would be helpful to
set some goals to keep track of how things are going. I tend to think of
goals in three different tiers, short-term, medium-term, and long-term.
Short-term goals are within the next month or two and fairly tangible.
Medium-term goals are within the next six months, and are somewhat
tangible. Usually the numbers are guesses, but they help see data
progress overtime. Long-term goals are usually guesses at best, and I
like to think of them as larger and more nebulous goals.

## Short-term, ~2 months (January 2016)

- Start the podcast and release 1 episode a week
- Publish at least three videos
- Publish at least one review
- Explore writing news summaries
- Get setup for recording video & audio content
- Have at least 100 unique visitors to the website
- Get 50 Twitter followers
- Get 10 YouTube subscribers
- Give livestreaming a try

## Medium-term, ~6 months (July 2016)

- Nail down the flow of content and approach
- Continue to release the podcast and have at least one episode get at
  least 100 downloads
- Have a guest on an episode of the podcast
- Continue to regularly publish videos, hopefully at least 20
- Write at least five reviews
- Based on how the livestreaming goes, regularly livestream videos
- Have at least 1000 unique visitors to the website
- Get 100 Twitter followers
- Get 100 YouTube subscribers

## Long-term, 1~2 years (~2017)

- Continue sustainably publishing content
- Attend a gaming convention and share my experience
- Interview a developer or someone in the industry
- Make a trip to Japan

It is no big deal if I did not hit the goals with numbers. They are more
just a way for me to see if the engagement is more or less than my
guess.

I am excited to see where Peaceful Respite goes, and I will be sure to
continue to share my goals and data overtime. Thank you for going on
this journey with me!
