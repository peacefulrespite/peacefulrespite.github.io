The Dark Souls trilogy is often praised for its game design, art direction, and difficulty. One of my favorite aspects of the games that doesn't get as much love are the soundtracks.

Motoi Sakuraba and Yuta Kitamura, two of the main composers for the games, created music that takes the atmosphere and mood of the games to the next level. The intense yet somber pieces when fighting bosses evoke sadness and pity while fueling the intensity of making yet another attempt at taking them down. The slow, low-key tracks when exploring are familiar and haunting. It all couldn't be more fitting.

Here are my 12 favorite songs from the three games, with a focus on the less intense and more listenable pieces:
