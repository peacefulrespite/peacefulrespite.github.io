Hello, and welcome to Peaceful Respite.

## Intro

First off, my name is Brett, and I am the creator of Peaceful Respite. I
am a software developer and video game enthusiast. I really enjoy
Japanese video games, and I want to create media surrouding them. I am
interested in writing, podcasts, and video, so I thought this would be a
great way to share something I am passionate about and do something new.

My goal with Peaceful Respite is to create content focused on Japanese
and Japanese-inspired video games. I will be writing blog posts,
creating videos, and recording podcasts talking about new releases,
classics, my favorite games, and criticisms of games that originate from
Japan. I want to make everything I create free and accessible. There
will be no ads, as I want to create a really nice experience.

## Why Japanese Games?

To be honest, there is something about the style of Japanese video games
that really appeals to me. I really enjoy the general art style that
comes out of Japan, from the nitty gritty of _Dark Souls_ to the classic
_Final Fantasy_ pixel art. Covering a specific subset of games feels
more doable as a hobby. Covering all of video games would be
overwhelming and difficult to do for me in my free time.

## Thanks!

Peaceful Respite is just getting started, so there is not much content
to enjoy yet. Please stay tuned here and [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/peacefulrespite) as it starts to kick-off.
Thank you very much!
