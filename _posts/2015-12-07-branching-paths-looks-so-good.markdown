_Branching Paths_ is an upcoming documentary that aims to explore the Japanese independent game dev scene directed by [Anne Ferrero](https://twitter.com/katsudon45). The trailer is really touching. It is set to release in January 2016, and I am really looking forward to watching it.

The _Branching Paths_ [website](http://branchingpaths.jp/) has some more details about the film.
