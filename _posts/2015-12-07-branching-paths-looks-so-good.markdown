_Branching Paths_ is an upcoming documentary that aims to explore the
Japanese independent game dev scene directed by [Anne
Ferrero](https://twitter.com/katsudon45). The trailer is really
touching.  It is set to release in January 2016, and I am really looking
forward to watching it.

The _Branching Paths_ [website](http://branchingpaths.jp/) has some more
details about the film.
