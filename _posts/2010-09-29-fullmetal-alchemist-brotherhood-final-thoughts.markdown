I recently, as within the past few days, finished watching Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It was a long ride, one of the first longer than one season shows I have stuck out. However, that long ride was incredibly enjoyable. I don't know if I have ever gotten so much enjoyment from watching an anime series while being drawn into the characters, world, and story. By the end of the series, I found myself crying, laughing, and smiling. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood maintains the charm the series is known for, the awesome characters that have become staples of anime, and also adds much more than presented in the original series.

The entire story wraps up very nicely by the end of the 64th episode a.k.a. the last episode. The ending is very positive and allows for possible sequels (doubtful but it's nice to think about) or speculation. There has been a movie <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-07-04/fullmetal-alchemist/brotherhood-movie-green-lit">announced</a>, but what the story will be about has yet to be announced.

Now I think that a movie is a good idea, mostly because I really enjoy FMA as a franchise (can I call it that?) and would love to see more of it. The way Brotherhood ended, I feel that a movie wouldn't do it justice. It felt fine the way it ended, they don't need to add more and wrap it up like they did with the original series. Conqueror of Shambala was pretty much needed to end the story of the original once it got past the story of the original. CoS was an enjoyable movie, but it seemed a bit out there when you really look at it.

Either way, I am very pleased with how Brotherhood was handled, how it turned out, and am excited for whatever the movie may entail.

<i>Oh yeah! I forgot, I recently started watching the OVAs (there are 4 of them). They are pretty enjoyable, you see some variations in animation style, and typically are funny, sad, or tell an interesting story. More to come on them once I finish them!</i>

What did you think of the series?
