The latest Capcom fighting game coming to the states is Capcom vs. Tatsunoko: Ulimate All-Stars for the Nintendo Wii. The game features an all start cast from both Capcom and Tatsunoko properties. Some of the characters that I am looking most forward to playing as are Mega Man, Joe from Viewtiful Joe, Ryu, and Casshern. The game was announced to be released, yesterday on Campcom's <a href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/jgonzo/blog/2009/09/23/tgs_2009_tatsunoko_vs_capcom_ultimate_allstars_its_frank_west_baby">Blog</a>, on January 26, 2010 in the U.S.A.

I still can't believe that this title is coming to the states. When it was released last year in Japan I saw a little bit of the coverage, and it looked awesome, but I thought to myself no way this would ever be released here. When it was announced that it was coming over, I was shocked. It truly is an "all-star" game. If the combat is done right with the Wii controller scheme (like in Super Smash Bros. Brawl) it can be a fantastic game. The Wii can always use high-quality third-party games.

Here is the Tokyo Game Show 2009 Trailer:

I like the music, the trailer looks real good with the style and all.
