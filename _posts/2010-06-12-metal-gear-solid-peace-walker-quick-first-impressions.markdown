One of my more anticipated games of 2010, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker was recently released this past Tuesday, June 8, 2010, on the PSP. As of this post, I am at 3 hours and 12 minutes of play time. Nothing to brag about, but I haven't had my time to sink my teeth into the game. So far tough, it's fantastic. One of better games I have played on any system, let alone the PSP. I've tried out the co-op with a buddy, dabbled in the versus ops, done some of the extra ops, and spent some time at Mother Base with the R&amp;D and staff assignment sections. There is <i>so</i> much to do in this game, it is crazy.

The game takes place after Metal Gear Solid 3 and follows Big Boss Snake. It seems to be a typical MGS storyline so far, very confusing to me as of this point.

The cut scenes are presented in a comic book style, which is pretty enjoyable. The animation techniques used for it are surprising and stunning at times. The voice acting is incredibly solid also.

The graphics are very high quality, like some settings and textures in the environment look great.

Game play is tight, there are three control options: MGS4, MGS: PO, or MHFU. Each one plays like the respective game it was based on. I personally use the MGS4 controls, it feels natural and works quite well.

One neat this is that there is an in-game item camera which allows you to take pictures (that's what all the screen shots in this post were taken with). It is actually quite fun to see what shots you can get, and the game saves the shots right onto the memory stick.

My personal favorite aspect of the game so far is the co-op missions. I played with my good friend through about 4 story ops and 3 of the extra ops. It was an extremely good time to be able to work together and communicate with each other while in the same room. We laughed and did ridiculous shit with the game too. It was just a lot of fun, as two big Metal Gear Solid fans. It wasn't competitive or some stressful multiplayer operation, it was just genuine fun.

The other big aspects of the game I've seen are the staff at Mother Base and upgrading weapons and items. I haven't played enough to get into the system of it all too much, but so far it seems like it adds a big RPG aspect to the game. This could be a lot of fun and add some extra playtime to the game. More on it as I play more!

That's all for now! Time to play some more.
