_Dark Souls_ is a well designed gem.

I purchased _Demon's Souls_ in the summer of 2010 after hearing about how
much people enjoyed it. That was the summer before I started college. I
played it for about an hour until I got stuck at the first boss. I never
played _Demon's Souls_ again until a few years later. Fast forward to fall
2011. A week after my birthday, I went and picked up _Dark Souls_. It was
my birthday gift to myself. Thinking back on it, why would I buy the
spiritual successor to a game I could barely get past the beginning of?

When _Dark Souls_ first released, I wanted to love it. I enjoy dark
fantasy settings. The feeling of being out numbered and having to get
better after each death really appealed to me. However, like Demon's
Souls, I played _Dark Souls_ until the first boss in the Undead Burg. I
could not for the life of me beat that boss. I never touched _Dark Souls_
again until early 2014.

During the time between when I stopped playing _Dark Souls_ and started
over, the game only grew in popularity. From the PC release with mod
support, to videos about the lore, to speed runs, _Dark Souls_ seemed to
grow in popularity.

I finally decided to give the game another try, as I started to feel
like I missed The Whole Point when I first played it. This time around I
was equipped with detailed wikis, boss guides for when I got stuck, and
a better understanding of the game's systems. This time it clicked.

I played the game for 30 hours and got my character to a level in the
70s. I really enjoyed chipping away at the game everyday. However, in
March 2014 I stopped playing the game due to moving and no longer having
a television or monitor to play on. Fast forward to now, December 2015,
where I have a monitor again to play the game on. I still had my save
from March 2014, and my memories of the game had not yet been completely
forgotten.

I loaded the save and was in Anor Londo. I had placed the Lordvessel.
After some exploring and figuring out where to go next, I was back in
it. Yesterday, I finally finished the game. It took me four years to
beat _Dark Souls_. I have never stuck with a game that long. I am glad I
did.

_Dark Souls_ is the most refreshing game I have played in a long time. It
is not overwhelming in its story exposition, and it teaches how to play
through great level design. _Dark Souls_ has a depth that continues into
the late game that few games do.

The way Lordran is a cohesive and connected world makes exploring it
more enjoyable than a game where the map is simply a sprawled out
landmass. In Lordran, there is depth and height. From The Catacombs to
Sen's Fortress, there are few areas alike. Exploring Lordran was a
highlight of the game for me. When it clicks how an area is connected to
another part of Lordran, one realizes how well designed the game is.

The combat of _Dark Souls_ is a bit different than most action RPGs.
Wieldable items, like sword, bows, and shields, are equipped in the left
and right hands of the player. The left and right shoulder buttons and
triggers are used for light and heavy attacks for each hand
respectively. This took me a bit of time to get used to as most action
RPGs use face buttons to attack. After playing the game for 40 hours, I
think the controls for combat are solid. Moving feels good, and when you
are in the thick of it, rarely do the controls get in the way.

Face offs with enemies, whether they are bosses or respawning creatures,
feel tense and require strategy. Rarely does rushing in and spamming the
attack button work. Strategies like turtling with a shield until the
enemy opens up or rolling out of the way and backstabbing the enemy are
much more successful. Also, just running past enemies is a totally valid
approach.

A major highlight of the game for me were the boss battles. Almost every
area of the game ends with a boss battle, and they all require different
tactics to win. The boss designs are incredible. From the detailed
horrific monsters to a giant wolf, I loved the feeling of entering the
fog gate and facing off against a new boss. I truly cannot think of a
game that has such memorable boss fights.

If the boss designs are incredible, then the non-boss designs are just
as incredible. In each area, the enemies are fitting and creative.
Rotting rats, giant oysters with legs, hovering statues that spit
flames. The list goes on and on. Each new area of Lordran has new
enemies that have a unique move set and require their own strategy. As
you die and try again, you learn a little bit about the enemies' move
sets each time. Once the move set is mastered, killing the enemies
becomes a breeze. It can be shocking how an hour ago you were killed
almost instantly by an enemy. Now you dodge roll behind and take it out
in one attack.

_Dark Souls_ taught me patience. Death is not the end in _Dark Souls_. It is
a lesson. A lesson in learning how the world works. How the enemies
think. No matter how many times I died, I kept moving forward, a bonfire
at a time. To me, that is the hook of _Dark Souls_. It is about taking
small steps, learning, thinking, and being patient. It is not about
running in, guns blazing, and beating the game in one sitting.

The music in _Dark Souls_ is wonderfully composed. The boss themes can be
fast paced and intense or melancholy. At times, there is no music and
just footsteps. It all works so well. My favorite song from the game is
Gywn, Lord of Cinder.

_Dark Souls_, at times, feels like work. Dying from falling off a ledge or
pressing the attack button one too many times and using all your stamina
in a fury of blows only to be killed by the enemy can feel defeating.
Certain enemies and areas can feel cheap, like the pitch-black area The
Tomb of the Giants and the boss fight with the Capra Demon. Also, the
frame rate can dip very low, to the point where it makes the game
difficult to play. The frame rate dips in specific areas, like
Blighttown and Lost Izalith. All things considered, it was not enough to
damage my thoughts on the game as it was fairly minor and not constant.
(On PC, I imagine the frame rate issue is less of a concern. I played it
on the PS3.)

The end of the game, which I will not spoil, is very fitting. It does
not have some long cutscene or explanation of everything that happened.
It fits into the narrative of the game, and it leaves a lot up to you,
the player, as to what you think it means.

_Dark Souls_, four years after its release, holds up incredibly well. It
has great design, all around, and if you are looking for something that
is refreshing and challenging, there is no game I would suggest other
than _Dark Souls_.
