The sequel to the popular PS3 Strategy RPG has been announced for U.S. release at Capcom's <a href="http://blogs.sega.com/usa/2009/09/16/valkyria-chronicles-ii-announced-for-the-us/">Blog</a>. The major difference is that Valkyria Chronicles 2 is being released on the PSP, not the PS3. The game is set to be released in Japan in Winter 2009 and in the U.S. in Summer 2010.
