[my thoughts on the game as a recent convert to the church of Falcom]

I've had _Zwei: The Ilvard Insurrection_ on my radar since it was announced at E3 this year. The game is an action RPG developed by Nihon Falcom, one of my favorite developers. It's a sequel to a _Zwei!!_, a game that never saw release in the West. It was originally released in Japan on Windows in 2008. I've enjoyed the Ys games from that era of Falcom development, and I'm always down for a decade-old obscure Japanese PC game getting released in English.

[how long I've played for]

[story]

You play as Ragna Valentine, an aeroplane pilot and treasure hunter, and Alwen du Moonbria, a vampire who recently lost her powers and castle. Ragna gets his aeroplane shot down while delivering a package to a museum, and he is saved by Alwen in return for his cooperation in helping Alwen get all of her powers back.

[gameplay]

Combat in _Zwei_ is pretty similar to Falcom's modern _Ys_ games. You can attack and jump, while also being able to switch characters on the fly.
(leveling up)

It strikes me as a little odd that there's no way to move the camera, as far as I can tell.

I like the way the game looks. It has a PS2 cell-shaded feel to it, which has aged well. It can look a little rough in spots, but overall, the cute and charming style works for me.

The music is good, which is a given with Falcom games. The rock tracks are fitting and as fun as ever.

[worth buying? + price]

At $30, (thoughts here)
